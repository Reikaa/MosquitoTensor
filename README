The MosquitoTensor package provides a Tensor class: a class which
encapsulates the data and methods necessary to perform arbitrary rank
tensor algebra in 4 dimensions. The dimension may be extended if there
is interest, and a differential algebra class could also be provided.

The code is provided as a drop-in file, instead of a library. So to use
it in your code you would need to include the "Tensor.h" header file in
the code using it and would need to compile the object code into the
executable. One can also make a library using the ar command and then
link to this.

=======================================================================

A brief outline:

Tensor::IndexType down = Tensor::DOWN;
Tensor eta(2, down, down);
eta(0,0) = -1;
for (int i = 1; i < 4; i++) {
  eta(i,i) = 1;
}

makes the Special Relativity metric tensor eta. Unspecified components
are automatically zeroed. One is then able to perform manipulations such
as

Tensor a = gamma["abc"]*u["b"]*u["c"];

to contract the rank 3 Christoffel symbols with the four velocity.

For better documentation, run doxygen by typing: 'make docs' and open
docs/html/index.html for a better description. One could also read
srcs/mainpage.dox but there is much markup language there. Due to the
presence of a formula, you will need latex to properly generate
the documentation.

The code is provided with GPLv3, details of the license are in COPYING.
